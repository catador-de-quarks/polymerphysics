# polymerphysics
In this project I simulate the behaviour of a polymer using Simple Random Walks and Self Avoiding Walks. This was a project for my Statistical Physics class. 

I could improve the code regarding the Self Avoiding Walk by letting the computer select a random direction and if that direction has been occuppied then the run ends, instead of saving the visted locations and weight the probability to those locations that hasn't been visited.
